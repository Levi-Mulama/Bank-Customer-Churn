Correlation Insights on Customer Churn

The correlation analysis between the top predictive features and churn provides deeper insights into customer behavior:

Age shows a positive correlation (0.29) with churn, indicating that older customers are more likely to leave the bank.

Number of Products has a small negative correlation (–0.05) with churn, suggesting that customers with more products tend to remain loyal.

Balance is weakly positively correlated (0.12) with churn, meaning customers with higher account balances may still be at risk of leaving.

Is Active Member is negatively correlated (–0.16) with churn, highlighting that active engagement with the bank significantly reduces the likelihood of churn.

Country (Germany) has a positive correlation (0.17) with churn, implying that German customers are more prone to churn compared to other regions.

Other features such as Estimated Salary, Credit Score, Gender, Tenure, and Country (Spain) show very weak correlations individually, but they may still contribute to model performance in combination with other variables.
