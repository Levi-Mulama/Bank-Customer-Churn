# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project explores and predicts **customer churn** for a bank using machine learning.  
The dataset contains details about customers such as age, tenure, balance, products, credit score, and whether they churned (left the bank) or not.  

The goal is to understand **what factors drive churn** and to build a model that can predict which customers are likely to leave, helping banks improve retention strategies.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle (Bank Customer Churn dataset)  
- **Size**: 10,000 rows × 12 columns  
- **Key Columns**:  
  - `credit_score` → customer’s credit score  
  - `age` → customer’s age  
  - `tenure` → years with the bank  
  - `balance` → customer’s account balance  
  - `products_number` → number of bank products used  
  - `active_member` → whether customer is active  
  - `estimated_salary` → salary estimate  
  - `churn` → 1 if customer left, 0 if stayed
